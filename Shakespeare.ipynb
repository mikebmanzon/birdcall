        "In this experiment, you will train models to distringuish examples of two different genres of Shakespeare's plays: comedies and tragedies. (We'll ignore the histories, sonnets, etc.) Since he died four hundred years ago, Shakespeare has not written any more plays—although scraps of various other works have come to light. We are not, therefore, interested in building models simply to help categorize an unbounded stream of future documents, as we might be in other applications of text classification; rather, we are interested in what a classifier might have to tell us about what we mean by the terms “comedy” and “tragedy”.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will start by copying and running your `createBasicFeatures` function from the experiment with movie reviews. Do the features the classifier focuses on tell you much about comedy and tragedy in general?\n",
        "\n",
        "You will then implement another featurization function `createInterestingFeatures`, which will focus on only those features you think are informative for distinguishing between comedy and tragedy. Accuracy on leave-one-out cross-validation may go up, but it more important to look at the features given the highest weight by the classifier. Interpretability in machine learning, of course, may be harder to define than accuracy—although accuracy at some tasks such as summarization is hard enoough."
